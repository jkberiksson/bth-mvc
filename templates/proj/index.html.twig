    <h1>Welcome to Blackjack!</h1>
    <p>Blackjack is a popular card game where players aim to have a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer without exceeding 21.</p>

    <h2>Game Rules</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Each player is dealt two cards.</li>
        <li>Players can choose to "hit" to receive another card or "stand" to keep their current hand.</li>
        <li>If a player's hand exceeds 21, they bust and lose the round.</li>
        <li>The dealer must hit until their cards total 17 or higher.</li>
        <li>Face cards are worth 10, aces are worth 1 or 11, and all other cards are worth their face value.</li>
    </ul>
